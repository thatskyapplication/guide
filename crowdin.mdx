## Crowdin

Crowdin is where you can help translate Caelus into your own language.

https://thatskyapplication.crowdin.com is where the magic happens. This is also where you can view a list of supported languages, which is defined by the languages both Discord and Sky support.

You need to sign up to start translating. Then, simply translate away!

## Translator role

In Discord, there is no way to identify which Crowdin user belongs to which Discord account. The Translator role serves that purpose and lets others know you help translate.

To obtain the role, visit https://thatskyapplication.com/discord-crowdin to begin the process. Once successful, you'll have the role! You obviously have to be in the [support server](https://discord.com/invite/Y7d6xGX9nG).
