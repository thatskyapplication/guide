## Setting up welcome messages

Welcome messages are sent whenever someone joins the server. Other applications do this, but Caelus makes it Sky-themed.

Setting them up is easy. Use `/configure welcome`! Once you hit the obvious edit button, a modal will appear asking you to edit a number of things:

<img
  src="/images/welcome-modal.webp"
  alt="Welcome Modal"
  title="Welcome Modal"
  style={{ width:"47%" }}
/>

Enter your desired information, and a preview of what the welcome message will look like will be revealed to you!

### Welcome message recommendations

- `{{user}}` mentions the user who joined
  - No other mentions will work, but they will appear correctly
- Mentions don't autocomplete in modals. It is recommended to type it out into a text channel and then cope & paste the contents into the modal
- Custom emojis may be used from the server & Caelus itself

### Disabling Discord join messages

You may have this enabled:

<img
  src="/images/discord-system-messages.webp"
  alt="Discord System Messages"
  title="Discord System Messages"
  style={{ width:"74%" }}
/>

If left enabled, both Discord and Caelus will trigger for join messages. It is recommended to **disable** the above setting to deduplicate the join messages. Caelus will offer a way to do this for you if Caelus has `Manage Server`, but if Caelus does not have it, you need someone with `Manage Server` to disable that setting.
