## Setting up notifications

You'll need a channel to send notifications in and a role for Caelus to mention. Once you have both, it's time to use `/configure notifications`!

When setting up notifications, you may choose an offset. For example, choosing an offset of 5 minutes means you will get notifications about the polluted geyser erupting 5 minutes prior to it occurring.

### Offset

The notification offset is how many minutes prior to the event the notification sends.

For example, if you choose to set a notification offset of 5, and grandma occurs at 20:35, you would receive the notification at 20:30 stating the event would occur in 5 minutes.

<Info>
  An offset of 0 notifies when the event starts.

## **What will it look like?**

When you first set up notifications, you may wonder what they look like, since it's likely not going to happen immediately. Check this out:

<img

  alt="Notifications example"
  title="Notifications example"
  style={{ width:"62%" }}
/>

As you can see, roles are mentioned when events occur with respect to the offset. Pretty nice!
