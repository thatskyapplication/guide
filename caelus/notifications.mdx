## Setting up notifications

You'll need a channel to send notifications in and a role for Caelus to mention. Once you have both, it's time to use `/configure notifications`!

When setting up notifications, you may choose an offset. For example, choosing an offset of 5 minutes means you will get notifications about the polluted geyser erupting 5 minutes prior to it occurring.

## **What notifications are available?**

- Daily reset
- Eye of Eden
- International Space Station
- Dragon
- Polluted geyser
- Grandma
- Turtle
- Shard eruption (regular)
- Shard eruption (strong)
- AURORA
- Passage
- Aviary's Firework Festival
- Travelling spirit
- Dreams skater
- Nesting Workshop

## **What will it look like?**

When you first set up notifications, you may wonder what they look like, since it's likely not going to happen immediately. Check this out:

<img
  src="/images/notifications_example.webp"
  alt="Notifications example"
  title="Notifications example"
  style={{ width:"62%" }}
/>

As you can see, roles are mentioned when events occur with respect to the offset. Pretty nice!
