Daily guides are automatically posted at 00:00 PT every day. When you first set up daily guides, you might wonder when the next day's will come. The answer is obvious: the next day! That's 00:00, in case you _really_ needed that clarity.

<Info>
  Daily guides are distributed at 00:00, but the daily quests need manual input. You can expect them to appear between 0-30 minutes.

The time zone in this image is UTC+00:00, which is why the timestamp states 08:00 (Sky is 8 or 7 hours behind, depending on daylight savings).

You can also see an example of what shard eruptions look like here!

## **Seeing daily guides ad hoc**

You can view daily guides at any time by using the `/daily-guides` command. This will respond ephemerally to not interrupt any ongoing conversation.

Daily guides are also accessible in the browser! You can share this page freely.

## **I want to help set daily guides!**

As mentioned above, daily quests need manual input. Anyone in the [support server](https://discord.gg/BFT7EAhrNz) can update the daily quests! Please read the documentation in the server or ask around for help!
